## Workflow

### 1. Welcome Page
- **Location**: `src/pages/Welcome.js`
- **Purpose**: 
  - Displays a brief introduction to the form builder.
  - Includes a "Get Started" button.
- **Navigation**: Clicking the button navigates the user to the Form Builder page.

### 2. Form Builder Page
- **Location**: `src/pages/FormBuilder.js`
- **Purpose**: 
  - Provides the interface for users to create forms dynamically.
  - A placeholder for drag-and-drop functionality and form element customization.

### 3. Routing
- **Location**: `src/App.js`
- **Purpose**: 
  - Defines the navigation flow between the Welcome and Form Builder pages.
  - Uses `react-router-dom` for routing.
- **Routes**:
  - `/`: Loads the Welcome page.
  - `/form-builder`: Loads the Form Builder page.

## How It Works
1. **Start the App**:
   - Run the development server using `npm start`.
   - The app opens at `http://localhost:3000` displaying the Welcome page.

2. **Welcome Page**:
   - The user reads a brief note about the form builder.
   - The "Get Started" button navigates the user to the form builder interface.

3. **Form Builder Page**:
   - Placeholder content explains the drag-and-drop interface.
   - Future updates will implement drag-and-drop libraries to allow users to build forms interactively.

4. **Navigation**:
   - The app uses React Router for seamless navigation between pages.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality using libraries like `react-beautiful-dnd` or `react-dnd`.
- Add a preview mode to visualize the built forms.
- Provide an option to save and export forms.
- Introduce themes and styling options for forms.
